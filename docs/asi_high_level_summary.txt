ASI High-Level Summary

1) Platform Topology
- Primary backend modules under `src/backend/` provide domain logic for resonance, policy, crisis, economy, and creator studio services.
- API entrypoints currently exist in both `api_gateway/` and `src/backend/api_server.py`.
- Frontend static assets are served from `assets/` with role studio and dashboard views.

2) Determinism & Validation Model
- Contract and schema tooling exists in `tools/contracts/`.
- Canonical/consistency checks are supported by scripts such as `scripts/enforce_canonical.py`.
- Duplicate logic detection scripts are available in `scripts/check-duplicate-functions.mjs` and `scripts/semantic_duplicate_detector.py`.

3) Security & Identity
- Google authentication logic is in `src/backend/auth/google_auth.py`.
- Enterprise hardening should enforce strict session lifecycle controls and default-deny RBAC checks.

4) Data Layer
- Current implementation uses SQLite patterns suitable for local/development workloads.
- Recommended production trajectory: PostgreSQL + migration tracking (Alembic) + explicit rollback strategy.

5) Operations & Deployment Guidance (Baseline)
- Define one authoritative API ingress path.
- Maintain mandatory signature verification, strict schema validation, and quarantine flows.
- Preserve effectively-once semantics and idempotent handlers when refactoring.
- Document deployment profiles (dev/staging/prod) and incident rollback steps.

6) Prioritized Improvement Areas
- Consolidate duplicated API middleware and route definitions.
- Refactor repeated business logic into stateless common utilities.
- Complete system/deployment/runbook documentation for faster team handoff.
- Apply Lighthouse-driven frontend performance optimizations while preserving CSP and security headers.

7) Reference
- Detailed execution roadmap: `docs/enterprise_hardening_recommendations.md`.

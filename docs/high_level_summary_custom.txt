Aetherium High-Level Summary (Custom)
=====================================

Delivered now:
- Feature freshness score by module (analytics/policy/alerting) with auto-pick of freshest module.
- Synthetic stress dataset (peak traffic + conflicting directives) for risk-ranking resilience tests.
- AST-level semantic duplicate detector for behavior-level duplicate function detection.
- Lineage hash-chain JSONL export for tamper-evident external audit.

Governance invariants maintained:
- Canonical event key strategy remains unified.
- Quality rubric remains consistent: confidence, freshness, completeness.
- Single-best-function direction reinforced through duplicate detectors.
- Dedup regression tests extended for evolving schema logic.

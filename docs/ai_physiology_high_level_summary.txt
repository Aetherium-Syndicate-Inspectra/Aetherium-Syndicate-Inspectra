Aetherium AI Physiology - High Level Summary
===========================================

1) Backbone (AetherBus Extreme)
- Async publish/subscribe event bus for agent communication.
- System-wide canonical keys are generated with one shared helper.
- Recent-event memory is bounded to avoid memory growth.

2) Immune System (ContractChecker)
- Validates payloads against contract schema (ipw_v1).
- Returns tuple contract result: (is_valid, details).
- Applies one quality rubric: confidence, freshness, completeness.
- Dedup keeps highest-quality event per canonical key.

3) Brain Stem (Gateway Main)
- FastAPI integration point for HTTP + WebSocket I/O.
- For websocket input: parse JSON -> validate contract -> canonicalize -> emit.
- Emits SYSTEM_ALERT on malformed or violating payloads.
- Supports reflex mode when tachyon_core is not installed.

Operational Standards Applied
-----------------------------
- Canonical key standard shared by all modules.
- Single best implementation reused (canonical + quality score helpers).
- Regression tests included for dedup and bus lifecycle functions.
